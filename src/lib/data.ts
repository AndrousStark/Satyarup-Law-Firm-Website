    content: `The Supreme Court of India has delivered a landmark judgment that fundamentally reshapes corporate governance standards for listed companies.

Companies must now demonstrate that their governance frameworks actively protect shareholder interests.\n\nKey takeaways include enhanced disclosure obligations, stricter conflict-of-interest protocols, and a new standard for assessing board member independence.\n\nSatyarup Law Firm continues to advise clients on the implications of this ruling and assist in updating governance frameworks to ensure compliance.`,
